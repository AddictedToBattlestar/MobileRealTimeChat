### 9. Add the ability to share photos

Objectives:
1. Install the camera plugin following the instructions at https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/camera/
2. Add a button in the left-hand side of the footer to capture a photo (home page).
3. Add a method which handles capturing a photo for the user.  Review the instructions in the first
  bullet point for direction on this.
5. When the photo is captured by the plugin, send a message with the content the plugin provides (essentially the "base64Image" variable in the documentation from the plugin).
4. Run `ionic upload` from the command prompt to push your changes to Ionic View on your mobile device 


Please use the below option settings for the getPicture method on the camera (to keep the images in the right format and reasonably small):
```javascript
{
      destinationType: this.camera.DestinationType.DATA_URL,
      encodingType: this.camera.EncodingType.JPEG,
      mediaType: this.camera.MediaType.PICTURE,
      targetWidth: 600,
      targetHeight: 400
}
```

Also, the code example that ionic provides for capturing a photo has not worked out of the box for me:
```ts
this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
 // imageData is either a base64 encoded string or a file URI
 // If it's base64:
 let base64Image = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData;
}, (err) => {
 // Handle error
});
```

You will INSTEAD need to trim out some un-needed characters in the image, below is a corrected example showing how this is done:
```ts
this.camera.getPicture(options).then((imageData) => {
 // imageData is either a base64 encoded string or a file URI
 // If it's base64:
 let base64Image = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + imageData.replace(/[\n\r]/g, '');
}, (err) => {
 // Handle error
});
```

Note:
- This is a feature that will only work on your mobile device.  I will not work in your browser.
- Once done and working, new messages will appear looking like "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZ..." which is expected (for now).
