### 4.messaging-service

Objectives:  
Create a message service that will provide a list of messages.  The service will also provide the ability to add new messages.  Review instructions at https://github.com/angular/angularfire2 for guidance on how to use this library.

1. Create a new file at src\models\ called "message.ts".  
2. Create a class in this file named Message.  The Message class will have the below fields:

| Field Name     | type   | Comment                                 |
|----------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| $key           | string | populated after save by firebase        |
|                |        |                                         |
| userName       | string |                                         |
|                |        |                                         |
| messageContent | string |                                         |
|                |        |                                         |
| messageDate    | string | automatically populated by this service |

3. Create the service by running the command `ionic g provider MessageService`.
4. Import the Message model built in #1-2.
5. On initialization the service will create a list binding to "/messages" in firebase.
6. Add a public variable named "messages" to provide messages from angularfire/firebase.
7. Add a public method to the service called "addMessage" that has the below traits:
  - Will accept a Message as a parameter.
  - Will update the messageDate property of the provided message to the current date.
  - Will push the new message into the messages you created in step #6.
