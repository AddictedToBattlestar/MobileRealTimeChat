### 12. Add the ability to view locations that have been shared
        
Objectives:
1. Use the Platform service to determine if the device you are using is Apple(ios) or Android. https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/platform/Platform/
1. Use an anchor `<a>` element to provide the location.  The href attribute for the anchor element should be set like shown below.
  - Apple: `https://maps.apple.com/?q=<latitude>,<longitude>`
  - Android: `https://maps.google.com/maps?q=loc:<latitude>,<longitude>`
3. Be mindful that this feature should only be visible in messages where it was provided in the earlier format, `geo:<latitude>,<longitude>`.
