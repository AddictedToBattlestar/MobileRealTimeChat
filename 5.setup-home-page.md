### 5. Setup the home page for the application

Objectives:  
Update the home page for the application so that it displays messages already sent as well as provides the feature to send new messages.

1. Delete all pages but the home page for the application.  As a note the app.modules.ts file will need to be updated to reflect this too.

For the home page:
2. Import both the Message model class and the MessageService.
3. Add a method named "send" that has the below traits:
   - Accepts a string as a parameter
   - Builds a new Message using the model.
      - userName should be hardcoded for now to your name.
      - messageContent should be the value from the parameter provided to the method.
   - Sends the new Message via the "addMessage" method from the MessageService.
4. Display the messages from the MessageService in a manner similar to Ionic's avatar list component.

5. Add an input to the footer of the page.
6. Add a send button to the footer of the page that on click it will call the "send" method with the text currently entered into the input created in the previous step.
